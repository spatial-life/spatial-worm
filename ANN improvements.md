1. Create a NN module in which the neurons self organise / move , form/unform the new connections in order to minimize the energy required for inference(mainly as this should heppen after it leanrns something)/learning.

2. Model / Nuerons dont have inherent way to understand if it has learnt something or still learning. an indicator state that it has learnt something or it is learning something. (cofidence score)
perhaps indicator derived from rate of change of local level loss curve.
this may help individual neurons/set of neurons to decide/plan/reduce/allocate more neurons for the task.

3. Optimization of the Neuronal information and the amount of them allocated to hold that information.
Perhaps this is what happens during sleep.
