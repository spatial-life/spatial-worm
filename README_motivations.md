## Reinforcement learning model is essential for spatial reasoning
The perceived sensory raw information is first run on a simulation.

The simulation anticipates, predicts few things.
the simulation has representation of the environment.
The simulation is constructed.
The actions are learnt.
The validity of the constructed representation and actions are iterativey learnt, generalised, improvised then it is stored for inference.


The stored learnings happen sub consciously, smoothly
The control agent monitors the live simulation the feedback is sent to the old simulation which gets updated.


the update step is a very selective process.
the update may :

*  apply corrections based on the scenario
•	Abandon some part of the previous learning
•	When there is conflict (no lack of pattern) it may not store in the memory and discard that learning.
•	Or if the process is still in progress it may temporarily store in RAM . but any new situation can knock this unclosed case off the RAM. May be only some fragments of it is saved.

There is a continuous inference engine.

There are priorities in the tasks to be processed.
The priorities are also learnt .
The priorities are executed based on the current state of the agent.
(survival/ Curiosity / realization(meaning) state .. maslow’s hierarchy ).

Agent exhibits all kinds of the priorities eventually and learns variety of the skills.

Agent exhibits a behaviour of like and dislike and may be selective about the data it wants to learn.



## What a Spatial / geometric problem may involve

Geometric Problem solving that involves:
•	Recognizing shapes, objects and 3d perspectives
•	Matching object’s features from different sources
•	Projecting/locating a feature from one source to another having different:
o	Perspective
o	Different orientation, scale
o	Color
o	Level of detail
o	Different representations (Drawing v/s photograph v/s cartoon)
•	Chose which perspective of the reference source to be related to which perspective of the target source(image)
•	Planning to solve the puzzle



 
A living organism learns from feeling the movement.
The Mechanic and physics of the world are learnt that way, 
 
We need Different kind of representation of same thing.
	Multi headed attention.















Can the continuity and the autoregressive Ness be inbuilt in the network structure itself

 
Does boredome creates curiosity?
Curiosity is an essential motive.


 
Several small organisms lower in the evolutionary chain exhibit emerging capabilities of visual reasoning. These organisms have relatively simple nervous systems but demonstrate behaviors that suggest some level of visual processing and decision-making. Here are a few examples:
1. Planarians (Flatworms)
•	Visual Structures: Planarians have simple eyespots called ocelli that can detect light intensity and direction.
•	Behavior: They exhibit phototaxis, moving towards or away from light sources. They can also navigate their environment using visual cues.
•	Significance: Planarians' ability to regenerate their nervous system and eyes makes them a model organism for studying the basics of visual processing and neural regeneration.
2. Drosophila (Fruit Flies)
•	Visual Structures: Fruit flies have compound eyes composed of numerous ommatidia, each functioning as a separate visual unit.
•	Behavior: They exhibit complex behaviors such as mating dances, navigation, and predator avoidance based on visual cues.
•	Significance: Drosophila are extensively used in genetic and neurological research, providing insights into the genetic basis of vision and behavior.
3. C. elegans (Nematodes)
•	Visual Structures: While C. elegans do not have eyes, they have light-sensitive cells that allow them to respond to light.
•	Behavior: They exhibit phototaxis and can navigate their environment using light as a cue.
•	Significance: C. elegans are a model organism for studying neural circuits and behavior, including how simple nervous systems process sensory information.
4. Octopuses and Squids (Cephalopods)
•	Visual Structures: Cephalopods have highly developed eyes similar to vertebrate eyes, with a lens, retina, and photoreceptors.
•	Behavior: They exhibit complex behaviors such as camouflage, hunting, and communication using visual signals. They can solve puzzles and navigate mazes, indicating advanced visual processing and reasoning.
•	Significance: Cephalopods are known for their intelligence and complex nervous systems, making them a subject of interest in studying the evolution of vision and cognition.
5. Jumping Spiders
•	Visual Structures: Jumping spiders have multiple pairs of eyes, with the principal eyes providing high-resolution vision.
•	Behavior: They exhibit complex hunting strategies, courtship displays, and navigation based on visual information. They can plan routes and remember locations.
•	Significance: Jumping spiders demonstrate advanced visual processing and decision-making, providing insights into the evolution of vision and cognition in arthropods.
